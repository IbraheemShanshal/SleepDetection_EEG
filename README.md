This project depends on Machine Learning, we will use python along with some ML libraries like sklearn to do this project.
To run the project, you must at least have have scikit-learn and Anaconda installed. You must also have Dash installed to run the GUI.
You need the output.pkl to run the GUI, which can be generated by running preprocess.py and then Machine Learning.py
