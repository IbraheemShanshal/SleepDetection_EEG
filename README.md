### Project Description
This project depends on Machine Learning, we will use python along with some ML libraries like sklearn to do this project.
To run the project, you must at least have have scikit-learn and Anaconda installed. You must also have Dash installed to run the GUI.
You need the output.pkl to run the GUI, which can be generated by running preprocess.py and then Machine Learning.py. Output.pkl needs to be in the file in order for predict.py to work.

### Setup Python SDK
Make sure python version is 3.9 and above <br>
Use Anaconda environment

Import Libraries<br>
* mne version 1.3.0
* mne-features
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn version 1.0.2 (It's an old version due to compability issues)
* warnings
* joblib
* matplotlib
* dash
<br>
If encounter any problem, run this code in windows powershell <br>
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

### How to run the files
1. upload.py and predict.py<br>
Change the file path of UPLOAD_FOLDER to -> r"the path you have copied"<br>

2. Run app.py.<br>

3. Click on the link.<br>
